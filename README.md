# BUILD A WEB SCRAPER WITH NODE
  You will need Node 8+ installed on your machine.
  Web scraping refers to the process of gathering information from a website through automated scripts. This eases the process of gathering large amounts of data from websites       where no official API has been defined.

  The process of web scraping can be broken down into two main steps:

  Fetching the HTML source code of the website through an HTTP request or by using a headless browser.
  Parsing the raw data to extract just the information you're interested in.
  We'll examine both steps during the course of this tutorial. At the end of it all, you should be able to build a web scraper for any website with ease.
